# Carousel with HTML and CSS only ðŸŽ 

This project is an implementation of an image carousel using only HTML and CSS, without relying on any external frameworks or libraries. The goal is to demonstrate how we can create a dynamic and interactive interface while maintaining simplicity and efficiency by using only native web technologies.

The carousel allows users to view multiple images in an automatic or manual sequence, with navigation buttons that enable transitioning between the images. For smooth slide transitions, CSS properties like transform and transition are used, ensuring a fluid experience without the need for JavaScript.

This project serves as a basic example of how to create dynamic visual components using only HTML and CSS, making it ideal for those starting to explore animations and interactive layouts on the web.
